Conversations + 
==================

Conversations + takes that boring crap you talk about and displays pictures about the stuff you mention automatically to make you more interesting. It's like how TV news works, only you don't have to wear a tie!

## Getting Started
The quickest and easiest way to get started is to go to: https://mikeflynn.github.io/conversations-plus/ Conversations + is ready to go once you grant the browser access to use your microphone. Say: "Coolio" and he will appear! ...that's actually all that version does, but I can't for the life of me think of anything else you would need.

## Customization
The link above is great if you talk about Coolio a lot (and who doesn't), but if for some reason you don't (maybe a Tone Loc fan?) you can clone this repo and run your own version locally.
